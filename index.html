  <h3>Steve Jobs</h3>
    <p class="d">What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story ive written as an adult (and certainly everyone that has been published), almost every email i have ever written have been written on machines created by Apple. I interacted online using an Apple machine long before i encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to realise the Star Trek vision i dreamt of as a kid. And through his vision, i have been able to realise my own. You'll be misssed, Mr. Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work</p>
